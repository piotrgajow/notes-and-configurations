## Facilitation

> Facilitators fill an impartial role in helping groups become more effective. They set aside their personal opinions and support a group in making its own choices. Facilitators act as process guides and create a balance between ensuring individual participation and producing meaningful results.

### Preparation

Interview, Research, Design
- discuss with key stakeholders what are the goals. 
- prepare a plan

#### Facilitation Canvas

- Purpose
  - What are we looking to achieve? 
  - Are we trying to make a decision, brainstorm options or align?
  - What are the implications if we don’t achieve this purpose?
- People
  - Who needs to be part of this session and what is their role?
  - Do we have all the right people to achieve our purpose?
  - What is the size of the group? Will they know one another?
  - Can you be a neutral facilitator?
- Inputs
  - What inputs (e.g. data, SME’s, insights, prototypes) need to be brought along to the session for background and discussion?
- Agenda
  How will we structure the session? Consider the following 6 steps:
  1. Open - Set context, confirm and agree purpose
  2. Background - Establish data and facts
  3. Discussion - Focus on the group’s opinions and views
  4. Ideas - What are the opportunities and options
  5. Actions - Agree decisions and next steps
  6. Close
- Environment
  - How will you create the environment in which the participants can achieve their desired purpose?
  - What techniques / exercises will help facilitate the session?
  - How should the physical/ virtual environment be set up?
  - What materials will you need?
- Outcomes
  - What are the outcomes needed to make the session a success?
  - What needs to be achieved to reach the agreed purpose? (e.g. alignment, consensus, prioritisation?
  - How will you as the facilitator know if the outcomes have been met?
- Outputs
  - What physical outputs / deliverables are expected to be produced in the session?
-  Pitfalls
  - What could hinder the session?
  - What are potential problems with the group you are engaging?
  - What could prevent them from achieving their purpose?
