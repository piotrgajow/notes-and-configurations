Ideas to improve team organisation

### Calendar & organisation

  - Where should it be noted down (calendars? spreadsheets?)

### Team mission, scope, ownerships

- What products, projects, repositories is the team working on
  - Onboarding from business and technical perspectives
  - Documentation
- Team one pager
  - Document saying what is and what is not in the scope for the team
  - What tools, repositories is the team owning & contributing to
  - How to contact the team (asking questions, requesting actions etc.)

### Team work process

- What projects / ticket boards should we follow
- How is the work prioritised
- How to handle new ideas (just create a ticket? announce somewhere? pitch idea to leaders first?)
- What is the flow for the tickets? Who is responsible for each step? How do we do handovers? Is it the same for all tickets?
  - Visualize with event storming notation
