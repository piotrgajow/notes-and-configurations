## Cognitive models / meta-programs

- Information categorizing 
    - similarities
        - looking for agreements and analogies
        - fear of changes
    - differences
        - looking for oppositions
        - like of changes
        - choice by elimination       
        - agrees when no differences
- Describing reality
    - Generic
        - "always", "never", "in general"
        - abstract examples
        - can generalize based on single case
    - Specific
        - "case exists"
        - details
        - sequences, step by step
        - only after details are set will see the bigger picture
- Authority
    - External
        - "majority", "X says", "study says"
        - need feedback, praise
    - Internal
        - "I know", "I have to check"
        - own retrospective
        - follows own beliefs
        - chooses which experts to follow
- Attitude towards the world
    - Problems and threats
        - away from the problem
        - sees threats and problems
        - focus on what went wrong or can go wrong
        - motivated by avoiding problems
        - know what not to do
    - Goals and prizes
        - towards the goals
        - sees potential gains and prizes
        - know what to do
        - "is good but can be better"
- Motivation
    - Reactive
        - waits for the trigger, best conditions
        - can be procrastinating, feel helpless
    - Proactive
        - initiates action
        - can be reckless
- Convincing
    - Necessities
        - "have to", "must"
        - follow rules, procedures and principles
    - Possibilities
        - "may", "want to", "have possibility to"
        - opportunities
        - bending the rules
- Priority
    - Myself
        - what I feel and think
        - my experiences
    - Others
        - reaction of and signals from others

## Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

### 1. Novice
- procedures and recipes
- specific steps required
- context is not important
- need for frequent feedback


- give clear instructions and rules
- do not provide too much context or details

### 2. Advanced beginner
- "child's hill" / know-it-all
- difficulties with problem solving
- need to have quick answers


- what has to be done and how to do it
- give analogy
- what to do in case of encountering problems

### 3. Competent
- operates on conceptual models
- independent / self-sufficient
- plans next steps instead of being guided


- goal, rules, patterns, good practices

### 4. Proficient
- challenge patterns and rules
- need to know "why?"
- need bigger context
- does not like simplifications
- see analogies and explore different domain


- show bigger problem
- ask and discuss possible solutions, choose best solution

### 5. Expert
- high intuition
- solutions are emerging
- use of metaphors
- require context


- refer to other experts
- guide with questions

## Kolb's experiential learning model

Cycle of:

- concrete experience
    - problem statement (problem adequate to skills)
- reflective observation
    - reasoning, what are the consequences, pros and cons
- abstract conceptualization
    - theoretic model, general principles
- active experimentation
    - testing in practice, improvements
    

Converger (active)
- abstractions -> experimentation
- believe there is single correct solution
- inference
- application of theories and rules

Assimilator (theoretic)
- abstractions -> afterthought and observations
- ideas and models

Accomodator (pragmatic)
- practical experience -> experimentation
- acting & doing
- engagement
- intuition

Diverger (conceptual)
- practical experience -> afterthought and observations
- observant different perspectives
- observing and looking for usability
